Welcome everyone! I hope you all enjoy my new mod 😉

**eZWeight** is a customizable weight system mod that adds a touch of realism and is perfect for survival or roleplay servers — or both! Players must manage their inventory carefully to avoid becoming overloaded and suffering penalties as a result.

> Fully configurable!

## 🎒 Main Features

*   📦 **Item-based weight system**, fully customizable via JSON files.
*   ⚖️ **Dynamic penalties when overweight**, such as no jumping, forced sneaking, or taking damage.
*   🧠 **Compatible with backpack mods and Curios**, automatically adjusting the total weight with extended inventories.
*   👁️ **Integrated HUD**, with visual indicators both on-screen and in the inventory for intuitive weight management.

## ✏️ Customization

eZWeight provides a flexible configuration through 4 core files:

*   `client-config.toml`: Adjusts HUD visibility and style.
*   `config.toml`: Controls base player weight and global penalties.
*   `levels.json`: Defines weight thresholds and associated negative effects.
*   `items.json`: Registers item weights, including support for modded items.

### 🛠️ Admin Commands

🔧 Easily configure item weights in-game with: `/ezweight gui`

⚙️ Useful commands for admins and players:

*   `/ezweight toggle <player>` — Enable or disable the system for a specific player.
*   `/ezweight toggleall` — Enable or disable the system globally.
*   `/ezweight info <player>` — View the current weight of any player.

You're welcome to include this mod in your modpack if you'd like! 😊
