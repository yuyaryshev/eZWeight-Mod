### 📦 Version 1.4.2

* 🛠 **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue where the *Traveler's Backpack* item would drop when its internal weight exceeded the player's maximum weight limit.
* ➕ **Improvement:** Players can now gradually pick up items from the ground even if they're at or over the weight limit, allowing for smoother inventory management.
